# 1. Project: installation steps

## 1.1.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version>12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

## 1.1.2 Dependencies

- [React](https://reactjs.org): Version 17.0.2

- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/): Version 6.3.0

- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/): Version 2.1.4

- [Prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types):  Version 15.8.1

- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)):  Version 3.6.10



## 1.2 Clone or download P12 repository

Clone the P12 repository CharlesLippens_12_08042022 (containing backend+frontend) : https://github.com/charleslippens/CharlesLippens_12_08042022.git or click on Code => download ZIP

Application hébergée sur Vercel (utilisant les datas mockées): https://charles-lippens-12-08042022.vercel.app/
Application en local: API/Data mockées


## 1.3 Install - Backend API

Inside the backend folder, install the packages/dependencies with command on terminal: `yarn install`

Run the Backend API, which will then listen on port 3000 by default with command on terminal: `yarn start` ( command which will allow you to run the micro API)

You will see the message Magic happens on port 3000 in the terminal window.

## 1.4 Install - Frontend React Application

Inside the frontend folder, install the packages/dependencies with command on terminal: `yarn install`

Run the Frontend App with command on terminal: `yarn start` and accept with "y" to run it on port 3001 when message pop up.

Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
